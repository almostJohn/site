when the world came to an abrupt halt due to the covid-19 lockdown, i found myself staring at endless days indoors, searching for meaning and productive ways to spend my time. little did i know that this unexpected pause would ignite a transformative journey into the world of programming.

## the accidental discovery of discord

isolated from friends and daily routines, i turned to virtual spaces for connection and distraction. that's when i stumbled upon discord—a platform bustling with communities from every corner of the globe. while exploring different servers, i encountered an exciting idea: discord bots.

i was curious. how could i, an ordinary person, create something that could interact with thousands of online users? my first steps were clumsy but promising. i started searching by simply searching _"discord bot creator"_ on the google playstore. i downloaded an app that claimed to let me build bots effortlessly. however, as i began to explore, i quickly realized that relying on pre-built tools wasn't enough. the app allowed me to craft a bot without writing code, but it felt like merely scratching the surface.

## diving deeper with discord.js

determined to truly understand how bots work, i discovered discord.js—a popular node.js package that interacts directly with the discord api. i immersed myself in the documentation, finding that each line of code was a window into a whole ecosystem of possibilities. since i already had a basic understanding of javascript, i initially felt comfortable experimenting with it. creating my first bot was both challenging and exhilarating, as it gave me a hands-on experience with real-world programming.

## transitioning from javascript to typescript

after a year of continuous coding in javascript, i encountered the limitations of a language without strict type definitions. this is where typescript entered my life and made a massive difference. with its static type-checking and enhanced intellisense, typescript transformed my coding experience. it felt like moving from a simple sketch to a detailed blueprint: suddenly, i was writing code that was more robust, maintainable, and easier to debug. i began to appreciate how the additional layers of safety and clarity in typescript helped me write cleaner and more scalable applications.

## my leap into web development

as my confidence in backend bot development grew, i found myself naturally drawn toward web development—a field brimming with creative challenges and endless possibilities. i started by exploring the fundamentals, then gradually ventured into building web applications. my first real love in the frontend world was react. i was captivated by its component-based architecture and how it allowed me to build interactive user interfaces with ease.

## embracing react and next.js

react opened a door to a new way of thinking about creating dynamic web experiences. soon after, i discovered next.js—a powerful framework built on top of react that streamlined the process of server-side rendering, routing, and even api creation. the integration of next.js with typescript was a game changer. it allowed me to maintain the precision i had come to love with typescript while enjoying the flexibility of a full-stack web framework.

i began working on personal projects that pushed my limits, each one serving as a stepping stone toward a deeper understanding of full-stack development. i explored how the synergy between typescript and next.js could simplify the creation of high-performance, secure, and scalable applications.

## looking ahead: creating, building, and innovating

today, as i reflect on my journey—from the early days of building simple bots during a lockdown to exploring the expansive domain of web development—I realize that every experiment and every line of code has prepared me for my next chapter. my passion lies in creating and building things that matter. with the power and flexibility of typescript coupled with the efficiency of next.js, i am ready to take on new challenges, shape innovative web experiences, and leave my mark as a web developer.

every bug, every breakthrough, and every moment of frustration has been a vital part of this adventure. it’s not just about learning to code; it’s about unlocking a mindset that thrives on continuous improvement and the joy of creation.

thank you for reading and making it here...
